# EveryDayBlog
This is coursework for my MSc Web Development at Edinburgh Napier University.

Its a blogging website made with ASP.NET MVC, C#, Entity Framework, AJAX/JSON, JavaScript, jQuery and Bootstrap for a mobile first design.
The application has new account creation, log-in, client side and server side validation, it has pre-loading of an admin user and blog items.

I created this application after only 2 lectures on the topic and with no JavaScript, C#, Entity Framework...
It took me about 2 weeks of intensive study and problem solving and shows my ability to learn new programming techniques in a very short space of time.
